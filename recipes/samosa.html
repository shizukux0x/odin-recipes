    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <p>Making the Samosas is a multi-step process. This guide will take you through making the savory filling and pastry dough. Then you will assemble the pastries and deep fry them.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Cook the Samosa filling</h3>
    <h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Place 3 medium-sized whole potatoes (300-400 grams) in a large pot of <em>lightly-salted</em> boiling water (2-3 cups). Turn the stove to medium and bring the potatoes to a boil. Boil for 7-8 minutes or until fork-tender, then remove from heat.</li>
            <li>In a smaller pot, boil the green peas and 2 cups of water for about 5 minutes, or until tender.</li>
            <li>Once done, drain the potatoes and peas in a colader and set aside to boil.</li>
        </ol>
    </h4>
    <h3>Roast and Grind Spices</h3>
    <h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Next toast the spices. This will release their oils and this is very necessary.</li>
            <li>To a small frying pan add your whole spices. Heat the spices for a few minutes over medium-low heat, until aromatic. Be careful not to burn the spices.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat and allow to completely cool.</li>
            <li>Then place in a coffee grinder and grind the spices into a semi-fine powder. No more than 6 pulses.</li>
        </ol>
    </h4>
    <h3>Assemble Filling</h3>
    <h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in a pan. add the cumin seeds and crackle them.</li>
            <li>Add the ginger and green chillies. Sauté for a few seconds until the raw aroma of ginger goes away.</li>
            <li>Add the steamed green peas, red chili powder, the freshly ground spice powder, dry mango powder and asafoetida.</li>
            <li>Stir and sauté on a low heat for 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the potato cubes. Mix very well and sauté for about 2 to 3 minutes on low heat with frequent stirring.</li>
            <li>Set aside the potato filling aside to cool at room temperature.</li>
        </ol>  
    </h4>
    <h3>Making the Samosa Pastry Dough</h3>
    <h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Take the flour, carom seeds, salt in a bowl. Mix well and add ghee.</li>
            <li>With your fingertips rub the ghee or oil in the flour to get a breadcrumb like consistency.</li>
            <li>The whole mixture should clump together when joined and not fall apart.</li>
            <li>Add water in parts and knead to a firm dough.</li>
            <li>If the dough looks dry or floury, then add 1 to 2 tablespoons more water and knead.</li>
            <li>Cover the dough with a moistened napkin and set aside for 30 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
    </h4>
    <h3>Assembling & Shaping Samosa</h3>
    <h4>
        <ol>
            <li>After resting the dough for 30 minutes, divide the dough in 6 equal pieces.</li>
            <li>Take each piece and roll in your palms first to make a smooth ball.</li>
            <li>Then roll it with a rolling pin keeping the thickness to 1 mm throughout.</li>
            <li>Cut with a knife or a pastry cutter through the center of the rolled samosa pastry.</li>
            <li>With a brush or with your finger tips, spread some water all over the edges. </li>
            <li>Join the two straight ends forming a cone shape. </li>
            <li>Press the edges so that they get sealed well.</li>
            <li>Stuff the prepared samosa cone with the prepared potato-peas stuffing.</li>
            <li>Pinch a part on the edge (check the video & photos). This helps the samosa to stand once it is shaped.</li>
            <li>Press both the edges. Be sure there are no cracks.</li>
            <li>Prepare all the samosa this way and keep covered with a moist kitchen napkin.</li>
        </ol>
    </h4>
    <h3>Frying Samosa</h3>
    <h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Now heat oil for deep frying in a kadai or pan. Once the oil becomes hot (test by adding a small piece of dough – it should come up quickly once added to the hot oil).
            <br>Gently slide the prepared stuffed samosa & quickly reduce the flame to low.</li>
            <li>Turn over in between and fry until golden. Drain the fried samosa on paper towels to remove excess oil.</li>
            <li>Fry them in batches. For frying the second batch, again increase the temperature of the oil to medium-heat. Do not overcrowd the pan while frying. </li>
            <li>Add the samosa and then lower the flame, thereby decreasing the temperature of oil.</li>
            <li>Fry remain samosas in batches.</li>
        </ol>
