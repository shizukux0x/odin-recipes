# odin-recipes

This is an inital foray into basic web dev skills.

- Includes some basic CSS, HTML, and Javascript.

- This project is secondary to my current RHCSA studies, but I would like to combine the skills gained from that cert with those learned from the Odin Project.

- I hope to eventually move into System Administration/SRE support. 

- After this project, I plan on completing a pet project of my own.
